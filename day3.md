Do you know about the month long celebration on open source?<br />
If you don't, let me tell you.
It is **Hacktoberfest** where several organisations open up their repo for contributions from fellow developers and it is for all the domains.
They have issues beginner friendly as well as for expert level.
Not only that, you get _swags_ based on your contribution too.
